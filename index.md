## My projects

### [SAC](https://github.com/darkrunedk/SAC)

[SAC](https://github.com/darkrunedk/SAC) is a project that makes a call to [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/), which is probably one of the biggest shops/communities for pc gaming. The platform has achievements implemented that users can achieve doing different kinds of things inside games. Some of these are hidden however, which is what this project tries to make accessible. What it does is it shows all the achievements that a specific user needs in a specific game.

I have also tried to make translations for this project as another fun little challenge.

### [Character Generator](https://github.com/darkrunedk/Character-Generator)

[Character Generator](https://github.com/darkrunedk/Character-Generator) is a small project that generates a character based on a few informations chosen by the user. This currently includes race, gender and class.
